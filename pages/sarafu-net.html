                <ol>
                    <li>Sarafu infrastructure is supported by humanitarian orgs and allows anyone in Kenya to receive Sarafu tokens.</li>
                    <li>The more Sarafu circulates the more it builds resilient local economies and support vulnerable households.</li>
                    <li>Holding fees (in Sarafu) encourage users to spend their Sarafu. These fees then supply further funding for basic income in Sarafu.</li>
                    <li>Humanitarian orgs use Sarafu trade data to identify weak spots for capacity building.</li>
                    <li>Note that no Kenyan Shillings are exchanged for Sarafu</li>

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The total Sarafu supply is ~16 Million and grows as people and groups join the network.</li>
            <li>In Kenya dial <strong>*384*96# (Safaricom) *483*46# (Airtel)</strong> to get your first  50 Sarafu and talk with our team +254-(0)757628885 to verify your information to get another 50 Sarafu.</li>
            <li>Get more Sarafu weekly the more you connect to others. This acts like a basic income and there is no cost to join. The Sarafu for these weekly distributions as well as initial allotments are refilled from a holding fee of 2% of your Sarafu each month.</li>

            <p>Based on results from research the Grassroots Economics team and partners are looking forward to the following:</p>
            <p>Next steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop the <a class="saf-link-style" href="https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-docs">blockchain contracts for the Sarafu token</a>  with demurrage.</li>
                <li>Enable communities to create their own interconnected tokens (no connection to Kenyan Shillings)</li>
                <li>Develop web-based non-custodial systems (wallets and token creation interfaces)</li>
                <li>Document and enable more interoperability with other protocols, APIs chat bots, market places</li>
                <li>Develop Voting systems for governance and tax (demurrage) redistribution</li>
                <li>Develop Standard Operating Procedures for humanitarian organizations.</li>
                <li>Develop different reserve pools (network tokens (Sarafu), stable tokens, carbon credits).</li>
                <li>Develop parametric triggers for aid injection</li>
                <li>Develop an SDG Impact Index related to CIC transaction data (categories, gender .. )</li>
